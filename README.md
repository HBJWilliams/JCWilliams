## Covid_19_Total_Deaths.png
<p align="justify"> 
<br>This chart comes from excel. It uses introductory statistics to demonstrate the probability of the death excess in 2020 occuring by chance.

<br>I originally made this for my 90-year-old grandfather. He has stayed inside and been quite cautious, but I wanted to show him, without going into deep scientific detail, the evidence for <i>why</i> he should continue to stay safe.

## Covid-19 Multiplot
<p align="justify"> 
<br>This is the result of my-self taught techniques in R. THe data shown represents a 5x10 grid of subplots, one for each of the 50 states in the USA. Each plot shows the weekly deaths from all causes from 2014 to 2020. The R-Markdown code from which this pdf originates is posted here as well.

### Errata
<p align="justify"> 
<br>I asked my statistics professor about the curious case of North Carolina. He noted that, unlike all other subplots, the y-axis includes negative numbers. Since it is not possible to have negative deaths, we knew that something must be wrong with either the code or the data. Upon further analysis, it seemed that the CDC data from which the plots came did not have complete data.
