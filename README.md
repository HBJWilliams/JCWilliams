<br>This chart comes from excel. It uses introductory statistics to demonstrate the probability of the death excess in 2020 occuring by chance.

## Covid-19 Demonstration.pdf

<br>I originally made this for my 90-year-old grandfather. He has stayed inside and been quite cautious, but I wanted to show him, without going into deep scientific detail, the evidence for <i>why</i> he should continue to stay safe.

## Covid-19 HowDoWeKnow.pdf 
<p align="justify"> 
<br>What started out as a project to help convince my grandfather to stay inside during the pandemic eventually transformed into a long and enjoyable process of learning R. Here, I show the results of analyzing data freely published by the CDC. Links to the source documents are also provided here.

### Errata
<p align="justify"> 
<br>I asked my statistics professor about the curious case of North Carolina. He noted that, unlike all other subplots, the y-axis includes negative numbers. Since it is not possible to have negative deaths, we knew that something must be wrong with either the code or the data. Upon further analysis, it seemed that the CDC data from which the plots came did not have complete data.

## Lab3
<p align="justify"> 
<br>I demonstrate an example of one of my lab reports to demonstrate the usual level of work put into an ordinary assignment. Furthermore, you will find the markdown code for the pdf is also present.
