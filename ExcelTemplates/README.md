# Project Descriptions
D&D Characters often use pen-and-paper systems to track data. However, I needed help rolling back my character sheets by level or tracking why each change occurred. I also wanted to make this template for personal use, so feel free to use it if you like!

It also showcases some intermediate Excel proficiencies, including:
* Naming Variable as cells
* lookup and reference functions across tables
* Aggregation Functions
