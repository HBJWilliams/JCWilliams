Hi Josh, 

I hope you're doing well!

We're assisting a student with a university project and were wondering if you could help us gather some data from the EMR. Specifically, we're looking for:

A year's worth of data that includes
* Date of clinic
* Location of clinic
* Age of patient
* Whether a glucose test was taken
* Glucose value (if taken)

This would be for all patients over the age of 35 who have been logged in the EMR. Let me know if this is something you can pull for us, and if so, what the timeline might look like.
